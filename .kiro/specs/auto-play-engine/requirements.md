# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The auto-play engine is a core enhancement to the Infinite Craft Helper that enables autonomous exploration of element combinations. The engine will simulate real player behavior by dragging elements from the sidebar into the play area and combining them to discover new elements. This feature provides hands-free gameplay for users who want to explore the game's combination possibilities without manual interaction.

The engine must operate through DOM manipulation and user interface simulation rather than direct API calls, ensuring it behaves like a genuine player. It will be built incrementally with testable components, starting from basic actions like element counting and selection, progressing to dragging and combining elements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to start an auto-play session that automatically explores element combinations, so that I can discover new elements without manual interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "Start Auto-Play" button THEN the system SHALL begin autonomous element combination exploration
2. WHEN auto-play is active THEN the system SHALL continuously select and combine elements until stopped
3. WHEN auto-play discovers a new element THEN the system SHALL log the discovery and continue exploration
4. WHEN auto-play is running THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator showing the active status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to stop the auto-play engine at any time, so that I can regain manual control of the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "Stop Auto-Play" button THEN the system SHALL immediately halt all automated actions
2. WHEN auto-play is stopped THEN the system SHALL clear any pending operations and return to idle state
3. WHEN auto-play stops THEN the system SHALL update the UI to show the stopped status
4. IF auto-play encounters an error THEN the system SHALL automatically stop and display an error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the auto-play engine to simulate realistic player behavior, so that it operates naturally within the game environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dragging elements THEN the system SHALL use realistic mouse movement patterns and timing
2. WHEN selecting elements THEN the system SHALL choose from available elements in the sidebar
3. WHEN combining elements THEN the system SHALL drag one element onto another in the play area
4. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL include natural delays between operations to simulate human behavior

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the auto-play engine to intelligently explore combinations, so that it efficiently discovers new elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting elements to combine THEN the system SHALL prioritize untested combinations
2. WHEN an element combination fails THEN the system SHALL record the failure and avoid repeating it
3. WHEN new elements are discovered THEN the system SHALL incorporate them into future combination attempts
4. WHEN the play area becomes cluttered THEN the system SHALL manage element placement to maintain usable space

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to monitor the auto-play engine's progress and statistics, so that I can track discoveries and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auto-play is running THEN the system SHALL display current statistics including attempts made and elements discovered
2. WHEN new elements are found THEN the system SHALL update the discovery counter in real-time
3. WHEN combinations are attempted THEN the system SHALL track and display the success rate
4. WHEN auto-play completes a session THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of results

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want the auto-play engine to handle game state changes gracefully, so that it continues working even when the game updates or changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game interface changes THEN the system SHALL detect the changes and adapt accordingly
2. WHEN elements are not available in expected locations THEN the system SHALL search for them dynamically
3. WHEN the game is loading or unresponsive THEN the system SHALL wait appropriately before continuing
4. IF the game state becomes incompatible THEN the system SHALL stop auto-play and notify the user

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the auto-play engine built with incremental, testable components, so that each piece can be verified independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing basic actions THEN the system SHALL provide functions for counting, selecting, and dragging elements
2. WHEN building component functions THEN each SHALL be testable in isolation
3. WHEN adding new capabilities THEN they SHALL build upon previously tested components
4. WHEN testing components THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about success or failure of each action
