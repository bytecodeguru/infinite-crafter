# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Restore foundation and basic game interface detection
  - ✅ Recreated GameInterface module with sidebar/play-area detection helpers
  - ✅ Exposed element counting and diagnostics via `window.gameInterface`
  - ✅ Added `runBasicTests()` smoke checks plus Playwright coverage for the API surface
  - ✅ Bridged logging so GameInterface warnings route through the in-panel Logger
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2_

- [x] 2. Implement element selection and identification
  - ✅ Split reusable DOM utilities into `src/auto-play/sidebar-helpers.js` and expanded `GameInterface` to return structured element metadata.
  - ✅ Delivered selection APIs (`getSidebarElements`, `findElementByName`, predicate helpers) plus draggable filtering and validation guards.
  - ✅ Added diagnostics (`logSidebarSummary`, `runSelectionDiagnostics`) wired through automatic logging.
  - ✅ Extended Playwright fixture with sidebar markup and tests asserting selection behavior.
  - ✅ Refreshed developer docs to cover the new console helpers.
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 7.1_

- [x] 3. Create basic mouse event simulation
  - ✅ Added `src/auto-play/action-simulator.js` with factory API, pointer tracking, and mouse event dispatch helpers.
  - ✅ Implemented delay/jitter controls plus sequence execution utilities and logging hooks.
  - ✅ Covered the simulator with unit tests and extended Playwright specs to verify live DOM clicks.
