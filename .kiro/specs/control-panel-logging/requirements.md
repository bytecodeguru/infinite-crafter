# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a comprehensive logging system to the Infinite Craft Helper control panel. The logging system will capture console messages, display them in an organized interface within the control panel, and provide functionality to copy logs to the clipboard for easy sharing and debugging. This enhancement addresses the tedious process of manually checking Chrome DevTools console logs by bringing log visibility directly into the userscript interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the Infinite Craft Helper, I want to see console logs directly in the control panel, so that I don't have to open Chrome DevTools to monitor what's happening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the control panel is displayed THEN the system SHALL include a dedicated logs section
2. WHEN console messages are generated THEN the system SHALL capture and display them in the logs section
3. WHEN logs are displayed THEN the system SHALL show timestamp, log level, and message content
4. WHEN multiple log entries exist THEN the system SHALL display them in chronological order with the newest at the top

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user debugging issues, I want to copy all logs to my clipboard, so that I can easily share them with others or save them for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the logs section is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a "Copy" button
2. WHEN the Copy button is clicked THEN the system SHALL copy all visible logs to the clipboard in a readable format
3. WHEN logs are copied THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback confirming the copy operation
4. WHEN no logs exist THEN the Copy button SHALL be disabled or show appropriate messaging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with limited screen space, I want to control the visibility and size of the logs section, so that it doesn't interfere with my gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the logs section is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a way to collapse/expand the section
2. WHEN the logs section contains many entries THEN the system SHALL limit the display height and provide scrolling
3. WHEN the logs section is collapsed THEN the system SHALL show a summary indicator of log count or recent activity
4. WHEN the control panel is dragged THEN the logs section SHALL move with the panel maintaining its state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the userscript, I want different log levels to be visually distinguished, so that I can quickly identify errors, warnings, and informational messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN error messages are logged THEN the system SHALL display them with red styling or error indicators
2. WHEN warning messages are logged THEN the system SHALL display them with yellow/orange styling or warning indicators
3. WHEN info messages are logged THEN the system SHALL display them with neutral styling
4. WHEN debug messages are logged THEN the system SHALL display them with muted styling or allow filtering

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user who runs the script for extended periods, I want log management features, so that the logs don't consume excessive memory or become unmanageable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logs exceed a maximum count THEN the system SHALL automatically remove the oldest entries
2. WHEN the logs section is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a "Clear" button to manually remove all logs
3. WHEN logs are cleared THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation and update the display immediately
4. WHEN the userscript is reloaded THEN the system SHALL start with an empty log history
