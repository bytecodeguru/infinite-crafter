- [ ] 2. Implement console interception system
  - Create LogCapture class that safely intercepts console methods (log, warn, error, info, debug)
  - Ensure original console functionality is preserved and forwarded

  - Test console interception with various message types and objects
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 3. Build log display UI components
  - Extend createControlPanel() function to include logs section HTML structure
  - Create LogDisplay class for rendering and managing the logs UI
  - Implement log entry formatting with timestamp, level icons, and message content
  - Add visual styling for different log levels (error=red, warn=orange, info=blue, debug=muted)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 4. Add collapse/expand functionality
  - Implement toggle button in logs section header
  - Add smooth CSS transitions for collapse/expand animations
  - Store collapse state and maintain it during panel interactions
  - Show log count indicator when collapsed
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 5. Implement scrolling and height management
  - Set maximum height for logs section with overflow scrolling
  - Auto-scroll to newest log entries when new logs arrive
  - Ensure scrolling works properly within the draggable panel
  - Test scrolling behavior with many log entries
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 6. Create copy-to-clipboard functionality
  - Add Copy button to logs section header
  - Implement clipboard API with fallback for older browsers
  - Format logs for clipboard with readable timestamp and level formatting
  - Add visual feedback (button text change, animation) when copy succeeds
  - Handle clipboard API failures gracefully with user messaging
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 7. Add clear logs functionality
  - Implement Clear button in logs section header
  - Add confirmation dialog or immediate clear with undo option
  - Update UI immediately when logs are cleared
  - Disable Copy button when no logs exist
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 5.3_

- [ ] 8. Integrate with existing CSS styling system
  - Extend addStyles() function with logs section CSS
  - Ensure consistent styling with existing panel design
  - Add responsive design for different panel sizes
  - Test visual integration with existing panel header and content
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 9. Wire up complete logging system initialization
  - Modify init() function to initialize logging components
  - Connect LogCapture, LogManager, and LogDisplay components
  - Start console interception after DOM is ready
  - Test integration with existing GameInterface logging
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 5.4_

- [ ] 10. Add comprehensive error handling and testing
  - Test memory management with high-frequency logging scenarios
  - Verify console interception doesn't break existing functionality
  - Test clipboard functionality across different browsers and content types
  - Validate UI responsiveness with large numbers of log entries
  - Test compatibility with existing panel dragging and positioning
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_
