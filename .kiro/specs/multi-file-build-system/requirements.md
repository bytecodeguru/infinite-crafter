# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Infinite Craft Helper userscript has grown beyond 1000 lines and needs to be split into multiple source files for better maintainability, while still producing a single distributable userscript file. This feature will implement a build system that allows developers to work with organized, modular source files during development while automatically generating the single-file userscript for distribution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to split the large userscript into multiple organized source files, so that I can maintain and develop features more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build system is implemented THEN the system SHALL support splitting the userscript into logical modules (UI, events, utilities, core functionality)
2. WHEN organizing source files THEN the system SHALL maintain a clear directory structure that separates concerns
3. WHEN working with source files THEN each file SHALL be focused on a single responsibility and be under 300 lines when possible
4. IF a developer modifies any source file THEN the system SHALL be able to rebuild the complete userscript

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated build process that combines source files into a single userscript, so that I don't have to manually manage file concatenation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL combine all source files into a single userscript file
2. WHEN building the userscript THEN the system SHALL preserve the userscript metadata header with correct version, URLs, and permissions
3. WHEN combining files THEN the system SHALL maintain proper JavaScript scope and avoid naming conflicts
4. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL produce a valid userscript that works identically to the original single file
5. IF source files contain ES6 modules THEN the system SHALL resolve imports and create a bundled output

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system to integrate with the existing branch-based development workflow, so that feature branches can be tested with the multi-file structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working on a feature branch THEN the build system SHALL generate userscripts with branch-specific URLs
2. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL generate userscripts with main branch URLs
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL automatically update version numbers based on branch and build context
4. IF building for a feature branch THEN the system SHALL include branch identifier in the version string

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want development tools that make working with multiple files efficient, so that the development experience is improved rather than complicated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL provide a watch mode that automatically rebuilds on file changes
2. WHEN running the build THEN the system SHALL complete in under 5 seconds for typical userscript sizes
3. WHEN build errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which source file and line caused the issue
4. WHEN the build succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation and output file location

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the source file organization to be intuitive and maintainable, so that new contributors can easily understand and modify the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing source files THEN the system SHALL use a logical directory structure (src/core/, src/ui/, src/utils/, etc.)
2. WHEN creating source files THEN each file SHALL have a clear single responsibility
3. WHEN importing between files THEN the system SHALL use standard ES6 import/export syntax
4. WHEN viewing the source structure THEN developers SHALL be able to quickly locate functionality by feature area
5. IF adding new functionality THEN developers SHALL be able to create new source files that integrate seamlessly with the build system
