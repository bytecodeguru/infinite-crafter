# README Update Summary

## Changes Made

Updated the README.md to reflect the removal of the LogCapture class from the userscript. The following changes were made:

### Removed References
- Removed the entire "LogCapture API" section that documented console interception methods
- Removed references to "Real-time console message capture with LogCapture class"
- Updated built-in tests reference to remove LogCapture from the list

### Updated Descriptions
- Changed "Console Log Display" feature from "Real-time console log capture" to "Built-in log display system"
- Updated "Smart Console Capture" section to "Manual Logging System" emphasizing direct Logger API usage
- Updated usage instructions to clarify logs are added through Logger API rather than automatically captured
- Updated screenshot example to show "Logs" instead of "Console Logs" header

### Emphasized Logger API
- Made Logger API documentation more prominent as the primary logging interface
- Added clarification that Logger API calls appear in the control panel
- Updated developer console commands section to focus on manual logging

### Changelog Updates
- Added "REMOVED" entry for LogCapture class removal
- Added "SIMPLIFIED" entries for streamlined initialization and logging system
- Updated feature descriptions to reflect the simplified architecture

## Impact
The documentation now accurately reflects that:
1. Console messages are NOT automatically captured
2. Logs must be added explicitly using Logger.log(), Logger.warn(), Logger.error()
3. The logging system is simplified without console interception complexity
4. Original console functionality remains completely untouched
